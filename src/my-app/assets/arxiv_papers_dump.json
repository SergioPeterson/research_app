        "abstract": "  This paper proposes critical pragmatism as a philosophy of sustainable mathematics education to bridge the gap between critical theory and the existing patchwork implementations. Combining existential sustainability as a holistic concept with pragmatic frameworks from the ethics in mathematics education literature creates a foundation enabling critical reflection and pragmatic implementation. We outline how their synthesis naturally leads to a three-stage implementation strategy: cultivating an ethical classroom culture, engaging with ethnomathematics, and tackling complex sustainability problems. Our critical pragmatic approach attempts to build a new philosophical perspective to equip teachers and students with the mathematical competencies, critical perspectives, and ethical grounding necessary to navigate and contribute to a sustainable future and to provide new analytic pathways.

However, authoring dashboard guidance is a time consuming task, and embedding guidance into dashboards for effective delivery is difficult to realize. In this work, we contribute DashGuide, a framework and system to support the creation of interactive dashboard guidance with minimal authoring input. Given a dashboard and a communication goal, DashGuide captures a sequence of author-performed interactions to generate guidance materials delivered as playable step-by-step overlays, a.k.a., dashboard tours. Authors can further edit and refine individual tour steps while receiving generative assistance. We also contribute findings from a formative assessment with 9 dashboard creators, which helped inform the design of DashGuide; and findings from an evaluation of DashGuide with 12 dashboard creators, suggesting it provides an improved authoring experience that balances efficiency, expressiveness, and creative freedom.

        "abstract": "  This paper presents a method for the joint detection and tracking of weak targets in automotive radars using the multi-frame track-before-detect (MF-TBD) procedure. Generally, target tracking in automotive radars is challenging due to radar field of view (FOV) misalignment, nonlinear coordinate conversion, and self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are caused by platform motion. These issues significantly hinder the implementation of MF-TBD in automotive radars. To address these challenges, a new MF-TBD detection architecture is first proposed. It can adaptively adjust the detection threshold value based on the existence of moving targets within the radar FOV. Since the implementation of MF-TBD necessitates the inclusion of position, velocity, and yaw angle information of the ego-vehicle, each with varying degrees of measurement error, we further propose a multi-frame energy integration strategy for moving-platform radar and accurately derive the target energy integration path functions. The self-positioning errors of the ego-vehicle, which are usually not considered in some previous target tracking approaches, are well addressed. Numerical simulations and experimental results with real radar data demonstrate large detection and tracking gains over standard automotive radar processing in weak target environments. ",

        "abstract": "  Recent works have suggested that In-Context Learning (ICL) operates in dual modes, i.e. task retrieval (remember learned patterns from pre-training) and task learning (inference-time ``learning'' from demonstrations). However, disentangling these the two modes remains a challenging goal. We introduce ICL CIPHERS, a class of task reformulations based on substitution ciphers borrowed from classic cryptography. In this approach, a subset of tokens in the in-context inputs are substituted with other (irrelevant) tokens, rendering English sentences less comprehensible to human eye. However, by design, there is a latent, fixed pattern to this substitution, making it reversible. This bijective (reversible) cipher ensures that the task remains a well-defined task in some abstract sense, despite the transformations. It is a curious question if LLMs can solve ICL CIPHERS with a BIJECTIVE mapping, which requires deciphering the latent cipher. We show that LLMs are better at solving ICL CIPHERS with BIJECTIVE mappings than the NON-BIJECTIVE (irreversible) baseline, providing a novel approach to quantify ``learning'' in ICL. While this gap is small, it is consistent across the board on four datasets and six models. Finally, we examine LLMs' internal representations and identify evidence in their ability to decode the ciphered inputs. ",

        "abstract": "  This paper presents a dynamic arthroscopic navigation system based on multi-level memory architecture for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. The system extends our previously proposed markerless navigation method from static image matching to dynamic video sequence tracking. By integrating the Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model's three-level architecture (sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory), our system maintains continuous tracking of the femoral condyle throughout the surgical procedure, providing stable navigation support even in complex situations involving viewpoint changes, instrument occlusion, and tissue deformation. Unlike existing methods, our system operates in real-time on standard arthroscopic equipment without requiring additional tracking hardware, achieving 25.3 FPS with a latency of only 39.5 ms, representing a 3.5-fold improvement over our previous static system. For extended sequences (1000 frames), the dynamic system maintained an error of 5.3 plus-minus 1.5 pixels, compared to the static system's 12.6 plus-minus 3.7 pixels - an improvement of approximately 45 percent. For medium-length sequences (500 frames) and short sequences (100 frames), the system achieved approximately 35 percent and 19 percent accuracy improvements, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate the system overcomes limitations of traditional static matching methods, providing new technical support for improving surgical precision in ACL reconstruction. ",

To enhance recognition robustness, a distance frame buffer is implemented that stores leader embeddings at multiple distances, accounting for the unique characteristics of leader-following tasks. Second, a goal-aware adaptation mechanism is designed to govern robot planning states based on the leader's visibility and motion, complemented by a graph-based planner that generates candidate trajectories for each state, ensuring efficient following with obstacle avoidance.

Objective: To develop and evaluate a dynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG planning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from 14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved segmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and coronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for cardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of coronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion analysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking Glass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert scale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients (including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with intraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly for preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based pericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings (r=0.786, P<0.001). Conclusion: This study establishes a visualization framework for CABG planning that produces clinically relevant dynamic holograms from patient-specific data, with clinical feedback confirming its effectiveness for preoperative planning.

However, existing methods often overfit to seen data, leading to significant performance degradation when generalizing to novel classes or unseen domains. To address this limitation, we propose DiSa, a Directional Saliency-Aware Prompt Learning framework that integrates two complementary regularization strategies to enhance generalization. First, our Cross-Interactive Regularization (CIR) fosters cross-modal alignment by enabling cooperative learning between prompted and frozen encoders. Within CIR, a saliency-aware masking strategy guides the image encoder to prioritize semantically critical image regions, reducing reliance on less informative patches. Second, we introduce a directional regularization strategy that aligns visual embeddings with class-wise prototype features in a directional manner to prioritize consistency in feature orientation over strict proximity. This approach ensures robust generalization by leveraging stable prototype directions derived from class-mean statistics. Extensive evaluations on 11 diverse image classification benchmarks demonstrate that DiSa consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt learning methods across various settings, including base-to-novel generalization, cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, and few-shot learning.

But given the wide variety of beliefs that agents may hold about the world and the rich language we can use to express them, which specific beliefs are people inclined to attribute to others? In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that people prefer to attribute beliefs that are good explanations for the behavior they observe. We develop a computational model that quantifies the explanatory strength of a (natural language) statement about an agent's beliefs via three factors: accuracy, informativity, and causal relevance to actions, each of which can be computed from a probabilistic generative model of belief-driven behavior. Using this model, we study the role of each factor in how people selectively attribute beliefs to other agents. We investigate this via an experiment where participants watch an agent collect keys hidden in boxes in order to reach a goal, then rank a set of statements describing the agent's beliefs about the boxes' contents. We find that accuracy and informativity perform reasonably well at predicting these rankings when combined, but that causal relevance is the single factor that best explains participants' responses.

While this design simplifies training for earlier generation models, it introduces critical limitations for diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks. In this work, we revisit the motion representation and propose a radically simplified and long-abandoned alternative for text-to-motion generation: absolute joint coordinates in global space. Through systematic analysis of design choices, we show that this formulation achieves significantly higher motion fidelity, improved text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a simple Transformer backbone and no auxiliary kinematic-aware losses. Moreover, our formulation naturally supports downstream tasks such as text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without additional task-specific reengineering and costly classifier guidance generation from control signals. Finally, we demonstrate promising generalization to directly generate SMPL-H mesh vertices in motion from text, laying a strong foundation for future research and motion-related applications. ",

        "summary": "This paper challenges the conventional approach to text-to-motion generation, which relies on relative, kinematic-aware motion representations like those in HumanML3D.  The authors argue that this approach, while simplifying training for earlier models, limits the potential of diffusion models and hinders applicability to downstream tasks.  They propose a simpler alternative: using absolute joint coordinates in global space.  Their experiments demonstrate that this method achieves higher motion fidelity, better text alignment, and strong scalability, even with a basic Transformer architecture and without auxiliary kinematic-aware losses.  Furthermore, their approach readily supports downstream tasks like text-driven motion control and temporal/spatial editing without requiring additional modifications.  The authors also showcase promising results in directly generating SMPL-H mesh vertices from text, opening new avenues for future research.",

        "abstract": "  Consider a discrete time Markov process $X^\\varepsilon$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ that makes a deterministic jump based on its current location, and then takes a small Gaussian step of variance $\\varepsilon^2$. We study the behavior of the asymptotic variance as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. In some situations (for instance if there were no jumps), then the asymptotic variance vanishes as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. When the jumps are \"chaotic\", however, the asymptotic variance may be bounded from above and bounded away from $0$, as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$. This phenomenon is known as residual diffusivity, and we prove this occurs when the jumps are determined by certain expanding Bernoulli maps. ",

        "summary": "This paper investigates residual diffusivity in discrete-time Markov processes.  The process involves a deterministic jump based on the current location, followed by a small Gaussian step. The authors focus on the asymptotic variance as the Gaussian step's variance goes to zero.  They demonstrate that when the deterministic jumps are determined by expanding Bernoulli maps (a class of chaotic maps), a phenomenon called residual diffusivity occurs, where the asymptotic variance remains bounded away from zero. The main result establishes a formula for this limiting variance, showing it's nonzero if the map's image intersects multiple unit cubes.  This provides a rigorous proof of residual diffusivity for a specific class of chaotic maps, which is a novel contribution.",

        "abstract": "  Intelligent object detection, which extracts crucial information like targets categories and locations, plays a vital role in emerging technologies including autonomous driving, the Internet of Things, and next-generation mobile communication systems. With the advancement of intelligent object detectors towards higher integration and miniaturization, their portability and adaptability to a broader range of scenarios have been significantly enhanced. However, this progress comes at the cost of reduced detection quality and narrower field-of-view, which severely impacts overall performances. Here we present a neural nanophotonic object detector based on a metalens array, capable of delivering high-quality imaging with an ultra-wide field-of-view of 135{\\deg}. The combined neural network not only further improves the imaging quality, but also enables the detector to achieve high-precision target recognition and localization. Moreover, we integrated the neural nanophotonic object detector into a miniature unmanned aerial vehicle to enable wide-angle imaging and intelligent recognition of various real-world dynamic objects, demonstrating the high mobility and flexibility of our neural nanophotonic object detector. Our study presents a systematic framework for advancing revolutionary intelligent detection systems, offering significant potential for a wide range of future applications. ",

        "abstract": "  This paper proposes an experiment designed to distinguish between competing interpretations of quantum mechanics: those that involve wave function collapse and those that assume purely unitary evolution. The experiment tests whether an observer can measure a system without collapsing its wave function.   To this end, we introduce the concept of an unconscious observer, defined by two criteria: (1) It measures a quantum system and sets the state of another system based on the result. (2) It allows an external experimentalist to infer the measurement outcome by examining the observer's state. The more distinguishable the observer's resulting states, the more it resembles a conventional measurement apparatus. Using weak measurements, the experimentalist probes these states, thereby testing the second criterion.   The interference patterns observed in this setup reveal whether collapse has occurred, allowing experimental discrimination between collapse-based and unitary interpretations. ",

        "abstract": "  Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception, prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view) computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA. We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0 PDMS. ",

        "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a framework based on the Retrospective Approximation (RA) paradigm to solve optimization problems with a stochastic objective function and general nonlinear deterministic constraints. This framework sequentially constructs increasingly accurate approximations of the true problems which are solved to a specified accuracy via a deterministic solver, thereby decoupling the uncertainty from the optimization. Such frameworks retain the advantages of deterministic optimization methods, such as fast convergence, while achieving the optimal performance of stochastic methods without the need to redesign algorithmic components. For problems with general nonlinear equality constraints, we present a framework that can employ any deterministic solver and analyze its theoretical work complexity. We then present an instance of the framework that employs a deterministic Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method and that achieves optimal complexity in terms of gradient evaluations and linear system solves for this class of problems. For problems with general nonlinear constraints, we present an RA-based algorithm that employs an SQP method with robust subproblems. Finally, we demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed framework on multi-class logistic regression problems and benchmark instances from the CUTEst test set, comparing its results to established methods from the literature.
